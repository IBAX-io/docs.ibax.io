It refers not only to IBAX’s infrastructure network environment. Instead, we will let decentralization take root in each ecoLib created in IBAX Network and use technical solutions to achieve a high degree of self-governance in each of them. For the purpose of highly distributed self-governance, we have made many changes in the overall architecture and technical implementation. However, in practice, we cannot avoid the centralized management concept. In order to find a balance between centralization and decentralization, in addition to the DPoA consensus mechanism, we have also formulated certain reward and incentive programs.</p> <p>IBAX Network has created a new consensus mechanism that combines distribution, weak centralization, and a certification authority. We call it DPoA (Decentralized Proof of Authority). To ensure continuity for the entire IBAX Network, the consensus covers not only IBAX Public Network, but also ecoLibs created by each user and user group. This creates a truly self-governed, decentralized, fair, transparent, and fraud-proof Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).</p> <p>DPoA has a prevention mechanism against network attacks and allows creation of Mint Nodes that guard the network and mint new IBXC coins. IBAXCoin holders can stake a part of their IBXC liquidity balance in Mint Nodes for Mint &amp; Stake Emission Rewards. Minting and staking serve to increase the cost and difficulty of attacks and increase the total value of IBXC coins proportionally. With this mechanism, the probability and harm of any attack are infinitely close to zero.</p> <h2 id="advantages-of-dpoa-consensus"><a href="#advantages-of-dpoa-consensus" class="header-anchor">#</a> Advantages of DPoA consensus </h2> <p>Compared to Proof-of-Work (PoW) or Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus, DPoA consensus has the following advantages:</p> <ul><li><p>No need of high-performance hardware. Compared to PoW consensus, nodes implementing the DPoA consensus does not spend computational resources for solving complex mathematical logic tasks;</p></li> <li><p>The interval of time to generate new blocks is predictable, but that for  PoW and PoS consensuses are different;</p></li> <li><p>High transaction rate. Blocks are generated in a sequence at specified time interval by authorized network nodes, which increases the speed of transaction verification.</p></li> <li><p>Tolerance to compromised and malicious nodes, as long as 51% of nodes are not compromised. IBAX implements a mechanism of banning nodes and revoking block generation rights.</p></li></ul> <h2 id="dpoa-consensus-and-common-means-of-attack"><a href="#dpoa-consensus-and-common-means-of-attack" class="header-anchor">#</a> DPoA consensus and common means of attack </h2> <h3 id="dos"><a href="#dos" class="header-anchor">#</a> DoS </h3> <p>An attacker may send large amount of transactions and blocks to a targeted node in the network, making an attempt to disrupt its operation and make its services unavailable.</p> <p>The DPoA mechanism is possible to defend against DoS attacks:</p> <ul><li><p>Because network nodes are pre-authenticated, block generation rights can be granted only to nodes that can withstand DoS attacks.</p></li> <li><p>If a honor node is unavailable for a certain period, it can be excluded from the list of honor nodes.</p></li></ul> <h3 id="percent-attack-51"><a href="#percent-attack-51" class="header-anchor">#</a> 51 percent attack </h3> <p>As to the scenario with the DPoA consensus, the 51% attack requires an attacker to obtain control over 51% of network nodes. But the scenario for the PoW consensus is different, which an attacker needs to obtain 51% of network computational power. Obtaining the control over nodes in a permissioned blockchain network is much harder than obtaining the computational power.</p> <p>For example, in a network implementing the PoW consensus, an attacker can increase computation power (performance) of the controlled network segment thus increasing the percentage of controlled nodes. This makes no sense for DPoA consensus, because the computational power of the node has no impact on the blockchain network decisions.</p> <h2 id="implementation-of-dpoa-consensus-in-ibax"><a href="#implementation-of-dpoa-consensus-in-ibax" class="header-anchor">#</a> Implementation of DPoA consensus in IBAX </h2> <h3 id="honor-node"><a href="#honor-node" class="header-anchor">#</a> Honor node </h3> <p>In IBAX, only honor nodes can generate new blocks, which maintain the blockchain network and the distributed ledger.</p> <p>The list of honor nodes is kept in the blockchain registry. The order of nodes determines the sequence in which nodes generate new blocks.</p> <h3 id="leader-node"><a href="#leader-node" class="header-anchor">#</a> Leader node </h3> <p>The leader node is the honor node that generates a new block at the current time. The following formula determines the leader node in the current honor node list:</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>leader = ((time - first) / step) % nodes

Factors that are probably result in forks are high network latency, intentional or unintentional time limits violation, time desynchronization at nodes. If network nodes have a significant geographic distribution, block generation interval must be increased.</p> <p>Forks are resolved by following the longest blockchain rule. When two blockchain versions are detected, honor nodes rollback the shorter one and accept the longer one.</p> <p><img src="/block-fork-resolution.png" alt="avatar"></p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><div class="edit-link"><a href="https://github.com/IBAX-io/documentation/edit/master/docs/it/concepts/consensus.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modifica questa pagina su GitHub</a> <span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></div> <div class="last-updated"><span class="prefix">Ultimo aggiornamento:</span> <span class="time">25/6/2023, 15:46:02</span></div></footer> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
